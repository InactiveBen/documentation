# Technical Reference

## Type Definitions

### SweepTask
A SweepTask can be any of the following:
```lua
type SweepTask = (() -> ()) | Destructable | RBXScriptConnection | thread
```

<Tip>
SweepTasks are the fundamental unit of cleanup in the Sweep framework. They can be functions, objects, connections, or threads.
</Tip>

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Function | A function that can be called for cleanup |
| Destructable | Instance or object with Destroy method |
| RBXScriptConnection | [RBXScriptConnection](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/RBXScriptConnection) |
| thread | [Coroutine](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/libraries/coroutine) |

### Destructable
```lua
type Destructable = Instance | { Destroy: () -> () }
```

A Destructable can be either:
- A [Roblox Instance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/Instance)
- Any object with a Destroy method

## Internal Implementation Details

### Task Storage
Tasks are stored internally in the Sweep instance using two main tables:
```lua
self._tasks = {} -- Stores the actual tasks
self._labels = {} -- Stores optional debug labels for tasks
```

### Task Indexing
Tasks use a numerical indexing system:
- Tasks are indexed numerically starting from 1
- Each task gets a unique ID returned by `GiveTask`
- Labels are stored with the same index as their corresponding task

## Memory Management

### Garbage Collection
The framework handles cleanup through several mechanisms:
- Tasks are properly dereferenced when cleaned
- Connections are explicitly disconnected
- Objects are destroyed using their Destroy method
- Threads are cancelled using task_cancel

### Connection Handling
```lua
-- Clean connections first to prevent any pending events
for index, task in pairs(tasks) do
    if typeof(task) == "RBXScriptConnection" then
        task:Disconnect()
        tasks[index] = nil
        self._labels[index] = nil
    end
end
```

## Debug System

### Debug Mode
Debug mode is controlled through ReplicatedStorage:
```lua
local debug = ReplicatedStorage:FindFirstChild("Debug")
if debug and debug.Value then
    print("[Sweep Debug]", ...)
end
```

### Debug Information
When enabled, the system logs:
- Task creation and deletion
- Memory usage (via gcinfo())
- Stack traces for important operations
- Task type information
- Connection states
- Thread states

### Debug Logging
The debug system provides detailed logging for:

| Operation | Information Logged |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| Task Creation | Timestamp, task type, label |
| Task Cleanup | Timestamp, cleanup duration |
| Memory Usage | Current memory usage, changes |
| Task Execution | Start time, end time, duration |
| Connection States | Connected, disconnected events |
| Thread Management | Thread creation, completion |
| Promise Resolution | Resolution time, state |

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Task Types
You can extend Sweep with custom task types:

```lua
local CustomTask = {}
CustomTask.__index = CustomTask

function CustomTask.new()
    return setmetatable({
        _cleanup = function() end
    }, CustomTask)
end

function CustomTask:Destroy()
    self._cleanup()
end

-- Usage with Sweep
local customTask = CustomTask.new()
sweep:GiveTask(customTask)
```

### Promise Integration
The Promise integration handles different promise states:

```lua
function Sweep:GivePromise(promise)
    -- Return immediately if promise is already resolved
    if not promise:IsPending() then
        return promise
    end

    -- Create new promise that can be tracked
    local newPromise = promise.resolved(promise)
    local id = self:GiveTask(newPromise)

    -- Clean up automatically when promise completes
    newPromise:Finally(function()
        self[id] = nil
    end)

    return newPromise
end
```

### Interval Task Implementation
```lua
function SweepTaskUtils.interval(interval, callback)
    local running = true
    local thread = task.spawn(function()
        while running do
            callback()
            task.wait(interval)
        end
    end)

    return function()
        running = false
        task.cancel(thread)
    end
end
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage
<Tip>
Optimize memory usage by cleaning up tasks as soon as they're no longer needed.
</Tip>

Key considerations:
- Each task requires minimal overhead (just table entries)
- Labels add additional memory overhead per task
- Debug mode increases memory usage due to logging

### CPU Usage
Performance characteristics:
- Task cleanup is performed sequentially
- Connections are prioritized in cleanup
- Interval tasks run on separate threads
- Promise resolution is asynchronous

### Best Practices

1. **Task Creation**
```lua
-- Preferred: Single task for multiple operations
sweep:GiveTask(function()
    cleanup1()
    cleanup2()
    cleanup3()
end)

-- Avoid: Multiple individual tasks
sweep:GiveTask(cleanup1)
sweep:GiveTask(cleanup2)
sweep:GiveTask(cleanup3)
```

2. **Connection Management**
```lua
-- Preferred: Group related connections
sweep:GiveTask(function()
    local conn1 = obj.Event1:Connect(handler1)
    local conn2 = obj.Event2:Connect(handler2)
    return function()
        conn1:Disconnect()
        conn2:Disconnect()
    end
end)
```

3. **Memory Optimization**
```lua
-- Preferred: Clean unused tasks immediately
local taskId = sweep:GiveTask(heavyOperation)
-- ... use the operation ...
sweep[taskId] = nil  -- Clean up when done
```

<Tip>
Always use task labels in debug mode to track task lifecycles and identify potential memory leaks.
</Tip>
